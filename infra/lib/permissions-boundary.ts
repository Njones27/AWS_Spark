// Every IAM role this app creates carries the `Spark-RoleBoundary` permissions boundary. The CDK bootstrap's
// CloudFormation execution role is bootstrapped with infra/policies/cfn-exec-policy.json, which only lets it create
// `Spark-*` roles that have this boundary, so no deploy can mint a role more powerful than the boundary allows.
// Both managed policies are created by script/setup_initial.sh from infra/policies/*.json. See infra/README.md,
// "Least-privilege bootstrap".
